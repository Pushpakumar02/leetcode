### Intuition and Approach

# To determine the minimum intervals required to complete all tasks with a given cooldown period `n` between the same types of tasks, we can follow this approach:

# 1. **Count Task Frequencies**:
#    - Count the frequency of each task using a dictionary.

# 2. **Sort by Frequencies**:
#    - Sort the task frequencies in descending order to identify the most frequent tasks.

# 3. **Determine Maximum Intervals**:
#    - Identify the maximum frequency (`max_num`) of any task. This determines the framework for the most spaced-out placement of these tasks.

# 4. **Calculate Idle Slots**:
#    - Calculate the potential idle slots needed by considering the most frequent task and the cooling period. The formula used is:
#      \[
#      (\text{max_num} - 1) \times (n + 1) + \text{counter}
#      \]
#    where `counter` is the number of tasks that have the same maximum frequency.

# 5. **Return the Result**:
#    - The result will be the larger of the calculated potential slots and the total number of tasks, ensuring that we account for cases where there are no idle slots needed because there are enough tasks to fill all slots.

# ### Implementation

# ```python
# class Solution:
#     def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
#         # Dictionary to count frequency of each task
#         dic = {}
#         for task in tasks:
#             dic[task] = dic.get(task, 0) + 1
        
#         # Sort the task frequencies in descending order
#         lst = sorted(dic.values(), reverse=True)
#         max_num = lst[0]  # Most frequent task count
        
#         # Count the number of tasks that have the maximum frequency
#         counter = lst.count(max_num)
        
#         # Calculate the minimum intervals required
#         ret = (max_num - 1) * (n + 1) + counter
        
#         # The result is the maximum of calculated slots and total number of tasks
#         return max(ret, len(tasks))
# ```

# ### Explanation:

# 1. **Task Frequency Count**: 
#    - We use a dictionary to count how many times each task appears.

# 2. **Sort Frequencies**:
#    - We sort these counts in descending order to get the task with the highest frequency first.

# 3. **Determine Maximum Intervals**:
#    - The most frequent task determines the basic layout of our schedule. For example, if a task appears 4 times, we need at least 3 intervals (cooldowns) between these tasks. The formula `(max_num - 1) * (n + 1)` calculates the total intervals considering cooldowns, and adding `counter` includes the slots for tasks with the same highest frequency.

# 4. **Calculate Result**:
#    - The final result is the maximum between the calculated intervals and the total number of tasks to ensure we accommodate scenarios with no idle slots.

# This solution efficiently calculates the minimum intervals needed by focusing on the task with the highest frequency and considering the constraints given by the cooldown period `n`.
