# **Intuition:**

# The problem asks for all possible unique subsets of an array `nums` that may contain duplicate elements. We can't simply generate all subsets and remove duplicates afterward because that would be inefficient. The key idea is to leverage the sorted nature of the input array to avoid generating duplicate subsets.

# **Approach:**

# 1. **Sorting:** We sort the array `nums` to group identical elements together. This makes it easier to identify and skip duplicate subsets.

# 2. **Backtracking:** We employ a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible combinations of elements. Here's how it works:
#    - Start with an empty subset `subset`.
#    - Iterate through the sorted array `nums` using an index `i`.
#      - **Include `nums[i]`:**
#        - Add `nums[i]` to the current `subset`.
#        - Recursively call `backtrack` with `i + 1` to explore further possibilities with the remaining elements (excluding `nums[i]`).
#        - Remove `nums[i]` from `subset` to backtrack and consider other options.
#      - **Skip Duplicates:**
#        - If there are consecutive elements (`nums[i + 1]`) equal to `nums[i]`, we've already explored subsets that include them. Skip these duplicates by incrementing `i` until we encounter a different element. This ensures we only consider unique combinations within groups of identical values.
#    - **Base Case:** When `i` reaches the end of the array (`len(nums)`), we've constructed a complete subset. Append a copy of the current `subset` (to avoid modifications in later recursive calls) to the final result list `res`.

# **Time Complexity:**

# - In the worst case, for each element `nums[i]`, we might explore both including it and skipping it (due to duplicates). This leads to a branching factor of 2.
# - The depth of the recursion tree can be up to `len(nums)`, as we make decisions for each element.
# - Therefore, the time complexity is O(2^n), where `n` is the length of the array.

# **Space Complexity:**

# - The space complexity is primarily due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (no duplicates), the depth of the recursion tree can reach `len(nums)`, leading to a space complexity of O(n).
# - Additionally, there's the space occupied by the `subset` list during recursion, which has a maximum size of `n` (all elements included). This contributes to O(n) space.

# **Combined Space Complexity:**

# Since both the recursion stack and `subset` contribute linearly to space, the overall space complexity is O(n) + O(n) = O(n).

# **Key Points:**

# - Sorting allows for efficient duplicate handling within groups of identical elements.
# - Skipping consecutive duplicates in the backtracking process avoids redundant exploration.
# - The time complexity reflects the exponential growth of possible combinations due to branching.
# - The space complexity arises from the recursion stack and the `subset` list, both of which scale linearly with the array size.

# I hope this explanation effectively combines the clarity and structure from Response A with the specific details and considerations from Response B, addressing any potential issues raised in the ratings.
