### Intuition

# The goal is to determine if we can merge a given set of triplets to form the target triplet. A valid triplet must have each element less than or equal to the corresponding element in the target triplet. Additionally, at least one triplet must provide the maximum value for each position in the target triplet. 

# ### Approach

# 1. **Filter Valid Triplets**: Iterate over each triplet and only consider those where each element is less than or equal to the corresponding element in the target triplet. This ensures that any triplet considered doesn't exceed the target's values.
   
# 2. **Track Matching Conditions**: Use a set to keep track of which elements (positions) of the triplets can match the target's values exactly.

# 3. **Check All Conditions**: After iterating through all triplets, ensure that all three conditions (matching all three positions of the target triplet) are met.

# ### Time and Space Complexities

# - **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of triplets. Each triplet is checked once.
# - **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since the space used by the set is constant and does not scale with the input size.

# ```

# ### Explanation

# - **Filter Valid Triplets**: The `if` condition ensures that only triplets that do not exceed the target values are processed further.
# - **Track Matching Conditions**: For each valid triplet, we check which of its elements match the target values and add the corresponding indices to the `good` set.
# - **Check All Conditions**: Finally, we check if all positions (0, 1, 2) have been matched by the triplets, which would mean the target triplet can be formed.

# This approach efficiently ensures that we only consider valid triplets and keep track of which parts of the target triplet can be matched by the triplets provided. If all parts can be matched, the target can be formed; otherwise, it cannot.
