class Solution:
    def getConcatenation(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ans = []
        for j in range(2):
            for i in nums:
                ans.append(i)
        return ans

# Intuition and Approach:

# - The problem asks for a list that is the concatenation of `nums` with itself.
# - We initialize an empty list `ans` to store the concatenated list.
# - We iterate twice (using `range(2)`), which means we'll iterate through `nums` twice.
# - For each element `i` in `nums`, we append it to `ans` twice.
# - Finally, we return `ans`.

# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of `nums`. We iterate through `nums` twice.

# Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of `nums`. The space used by `ans` is proportional to the size of `nums` times 2.
